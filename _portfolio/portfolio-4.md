### Collaborate with _Yuanjia Wang_

- Skill Sets: Python/Multi-threading
- Developed a web application using the Django framework and Postgres database to simulate Uber functionalities, including user
account management, ride requests, ride-sharing, and driver registration
- Designed a counter-intuitive data structure to match ride requests and drivers, by associating the “Share” model with a “Ride”
foreign key, efficiently linking rides to sharers and improving operational performance from O(N^2) time complexity to O(N),
avoid traversing Ride instances to find Sharers
