### Collaborate with _Hangming Ye_

- Skill Sets: C++/Proxy design/HTTP/HTTPS/
- Created a robust HTTP/HTTPS proxy in C++ that processes simultaneous GET, POST, and CONNECT requests following the
RFC7231 Protocol, forwarding to the origin server, and facilitating correct reception of chunked data
- Utilized a double-linked list and hash map to implement an LRU cache, optimizing CRUD operations to O(1) complexity while
maintaining a reasonable cache size
