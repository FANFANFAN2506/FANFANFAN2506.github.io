### Collaborate with _Shiyang Pan_

- Skill Sets: Python/Multi-threading
- Implemented and optimized a multi-process stock server using SQLAlchemy for database transactions, enhancing data integrity by switching session management strategy and setting isolation levels to handle concurrency and prevent deadlocks.
- Conducted scalability tests using a multiprocessing pool to handle concurrent requests, significantly improving server throughput by optimizing core utilization with taskset and ensuring transactional atomicity with row-level locks and process locks.
- Developed comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality and performance of all server operations, establishing a robust testing framework that includes transaction matching scenarios to ensure system reliability and correctness under various load conditions.
