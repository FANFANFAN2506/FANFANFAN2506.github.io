The research on the consensus protocol design has been carried out for the leaderless networked system in this
paper. When a specific node detects new information from outside, protocol for the new action needs to be designed.
For the multiple information access, nodes behavior in networked system show as group action. For the nodes
inside of group show the similar pattern, but the nodes locate in the middle of different groups face with challenge
to decide. In this research, we provide the measure to make inclusion to the specific group for the nodes inbetween
groups. In order to discriminate group inclusion for intermediate nodes, similarity measure has been proposed with
each node characteristics. To clarify different agentâ€™s characteristic, which is their preference on different leader
groups, the social weighting concept will be introduced. Depending on the characteristic function, we could decide
the grouping of inbetween agents with Shapley value method. The grouping consensus has been realized by the
Ofalti-Saber algorithm in both single input and multi-inputs situation for leaderless network, and through the
simulation, the algorithm is verified to perform well in the mentioned situations.
