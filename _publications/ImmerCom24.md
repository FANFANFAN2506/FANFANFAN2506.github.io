Inaccurate spatial tracking in extended reality (XR) headsets can cause virtual object jitter, misalignment, and user discomfort, limiting the headsetsâ€™ potential for immersive content and natural interactions. We develop a modular testbed to evaluate the tracking performance of commercial XR headsets, incorporating system calibration, tracking data acquisition, and result analysis, and allowing the integration of external cameras and IMU sensors for comparison with opensource VI-SLAM algorithms. Using this testbed, we quantitatively assessed spatial tracking accuracy under various user movements and environmental conditions for the latest XR headsets, Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3. The Apple Vision Pro outperformed the Meta Quest 3, reducing relative pose error (RPE) and absolute pose error (APE) by 33.9% and 14.6%, respectively. While both headsets achieved subcentimeter APE in most cases, they exhibited APE exceeding 10 cm in challenging scenarios, highlighting the need for further improvements in reliability and accuracy.
