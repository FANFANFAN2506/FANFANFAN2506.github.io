In order to regain the motor control of upper limbs, stroke patients should go through various exercises to resume finger, hand and arm functions. During such exercises, they need constant assistance, guidance and support from either therapists or caregivers. Due to the increase of aging population, the demand for technology support in home-based stroke recovery has rapidly increased in the last decade. This paper presents an interactive prototype designed to facilitate finger grasping, hand gripping and arm reaching exercises at home. It consists of a portable device with light, audio feedback and a computer game with two scenes and visual guidance. Preliminary usability testing in the community with elderly persons indicates that this device is easy to follow, and enjoyable to play. These trials explore the possibility and feasibility of implementing such tangible interactive training at home or in community rehab centers, inspiring us to improve such designs further to support active rehabilitation.
