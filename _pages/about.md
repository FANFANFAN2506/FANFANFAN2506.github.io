### Welcome! I appreciate your visit to my website. Thank you for stopping by.

Research Interest: Human-Computer-Interaction, XR devices, Embedded System, Advanced Sensing

## About Me

Fan Yang recently graduated with a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Duke University, where they conducted research on XR/MR devices in the I3T Lab under the supervision of Professor Maria Gorlatova. Fanâ€™s research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), with a particular emphasis on advanced embedded sensing systems, especially XR/MR devices. He has extensive experience evaluating localization and tracking performance for state-of-the-art XR headsets, such as the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3.

Fan is passionate about shaping next-generation immersive technologies that bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. His interest lies in exploring how Mixed Reality, artificial intelligence, and embedded sensing can be combined to create meaningful and intuitive user interactions. Inspired by projects that redefine user experience, Fan is especially interested in developing technologies that make AR/VR more accessible and practical for everyday use, including in healthcare, rehabilitation, and education.

With experience collaborating with international researchers and participating in research groups, Fan also enjoys connecting with like-minded researchers to explore the latest innovations in HCI and XR. He is currently exploring opportunities to join PhD programs that align with his vision of revolutionizing human interactions with advanced sensing and immersive technologies.
