- Skill Sets: C++/Python/Linux/SLAM/ROS
- Implemented a C++ multi-threading application with the Intel RealSense D435i depth camera, to extract data and evaluate the
performance of AR/VR headsets with Visual SLAM.
- Eliminated limitation with the simultaneous streaming, and increased the IMU data streaming rate from 30Hz to 100Hz,
achieving a 133% improvement in data throughput and significantly optimizing system responsiveness
- Leveraged the GNU Profiler to identify and address a file-storing bottleneck, reducing processing time by over 90% and
achieving real-time processing at 30Hz for RGB/Depth and 200Hz for IMU data by utilizing the OpenCV library
